# Kitten Boat

For Sylvie's Jam #1 https://itch.io/jam/sylvies-jam-1

A game that you hate but it has a cute kitten in it, so it's impossible to insult the kitten. The kitten can ride a boat sometimes. When you try to buy from the shop there's a random chance something bad happens. The boat is hard to control precisely. When you die, you have to rebuild the boat by playing a puzzle game style sequence. There is an enemy (jellyfish) who appears when the timer runs out and tries to get you. There must be island gameplay and boat gameplay. The goal is only to get money and buy expensive items.
